# :wave: C / C ++ Project 0 Code 

Create a new repo from this template, or add this project folder to an existing repo to complete the Project 0 assignment.

## Project 0 Complete | *1 July 25*
Project 0 complete, see changes in `c_proj0`.  Likely going to only be using the C side of things if I get the choice. Going to try to stick to doing this all in the terminal as well, because I want to get better with the github CLI.
